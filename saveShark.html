                <h3>Overfishing</h3>
                <hr style="width: 20%; background-color: #00bcd4; height: 1px; float: left;">
                <br>
                <p>The overfishing of sharks happens because of the huge demand—mainly for shark fins—and
                    a lack of management to ensure shark fisheries are sustainable. Some species, such as
                    spiny dogfish and porbeagle, are targeted primarily for their meat.

                <br>
                <p>Sharks are often caught incidentally by fishing gear set for other types of fish—such as tuna longlines, trawls and seine nets—and many will simply be discarded. This contributes to the decline of many species of sharks.</p>

        <h1>What You Can Do To Protect Sharks</h2>
            <hr style="width: 30%; background-color: #00bcd4; height: 1px;">
            <div class="point">
                <h2>Learn As Much As You Can About Sharks</h2>
                <hr style="width: 40%; background-color: #00bcd4; height: 1px; float: left;">
                <br>
                <p>
                    The most important thing you can do to help sharks is learn about the different sharks of the world, their habitats, and behaviors. Then learn how different human activities put them in jeopardy and which species of sharks are most threatened. By educating yourself on the issues, you can find effective ways to help. You can also help teach others about sharks and inspire them to get involved as well.
                </p>
                <h2>Do Not Use Shark Products</h2>
                <hr style="width: 26%; background-color: #00bcd4; height: 1px; float: left;">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Obviously a great place to start is by not consuming any shark meat. However, there are more products than just shark meat on the market. Shark cartilage and oils are found in a range of products from beauty items to health nutrition. So before consuming any product, make sure it does not use any shark materials. By boycotting shark products, you will reduce market demand, causing companies to stop killing sharks to make these products.
                </p>
                <h2>Reduce Your Seafood Consumption</h2>
                <hr style="width: 30%; background-color: #00bcd4; height: 1px; float: left;">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Commercial fishing negatively impacts sharks in two ways. First, it reduces the populations of their food sources, especially sharks that rely on bony fish as their primary food source. Secondly, sharks are often killed as a byproduct of commercial fishing. Sharks are attracted to the movement of the trapped animals, and may try to feed on them, getting caught and strangling in the net. They may also be accidentally caught by fisherman looking for other seafood. So by simply reducing your consumption of seafood, you can reduce the number of sharks killed each year.
                </p>
                <h2>Reduce, Reuse, Recycle</h2>
                <hr style="width: 22%; background-color: #00bcd4; height: 1px; float: left;">
                <br>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest threats to shark species is trash. With the massive plastic gyres and dumping, sharks often mistake garbage for food. Plastic is also consumed by the marine species that sharks eat. So sharks will eventually consume non-food products, leading to illness and death. So think about your impact on marine species when using products, so that they don’t end up causing irreparable damage to sharks species.

                <!-- <h2>Donate And Volunteer With Shark Conservation Organizations</h2>
                <p>
                    Letter writing is a great way to helps protect and preserve sharks. Writing a letter to your representative to tell them that shark conservation is important to you and that you would like them to introduce and support legislation that will list sharks as protected species, ban shark finning and fishing, and set up conservation areas in the oceans around your country can be a big help.
                </p>
                <h2>Write Your Legislators</h2>
                <p>
                    Schools are a great resource to help encourage people to get active in a cause. From elementary schools to universities, you can help promote campaigns that raise awareness, collect donations, and support conservation efforts. Teachers and students love to get active in causes, so talking to your local educators is a great way to rally people to help save sharks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you live near the oceans or are just on vacation, if you see someone abusing sharks, speak out. Whether they are poking and prodding them or illegally hunting them, tell the authorities what you’ve seen, Most beaches have protections for the local marine species, so if someone is mistreating a shark, you can help defend the shark by reporting the action.
                </p>
                <h2>Go Diving With Sharks</h2>
                <p>
                    Shark diving is a great way to protect local shark species. Governments are much more likely to set up conservation zones when sharks bring tourism revenue to an area. There’s a variety of dives you can do for any skill level and interest. Whether you go cage diving with Great White Sharks or simply snorkeling with Nurse Sharks, shark tourism will help support local conservation efforts.
                </p>
                <h2>Spread Awareness On Social Media</h2>
                <p>
